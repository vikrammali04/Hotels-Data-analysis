## Hotels-Data-analysis

### Project Overview
This data analysis project focuses on minimizing cancellation rates in both City Hotel and Resort Hotel using datasets obtained from Kaggle. The objective was to explore the datasets, identify key variables influencing reservation cancellations, and formulate actionable recommendations to address the issue effectively. By analyzing historical reservation data, the project aimed to provide insights that could enhance revenue generation and operational efficiency for both hotels.

### Data Analysis and Findings
The project involved an extensive data analysis phase, where I explored various factors contributing to cancellation rates. Through comprehensive examination of booking patterns, customer demographics, and seasonal trends, I was able to identify crucial variables affecting reservation cancellations. 

### Recommendations and Impact
Based on the insights gained from the data analysis, I formulated and implemented a series of recommendations to combat reservation cancellations. These recommendations encompassed pricing strategies, promotional campaigns, and service quality improvements. The project underscores the significance of data-driven decision-making in the hospitality industry and highlights the positive impact of actionable insights derived from data analysis.

Please note that while this project was not conducted for a client, the value lies in the insights gained from the data analysis and the potential for practical application in real-world scenarios.
